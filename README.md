[Predicting Michelin Star Restaurants in DC](/Projects/tree/master/Predicting%20DC%20Michelin%20Restaurants)

To predict which DC restaurants would receive Michelin stars (before they were announced!) I scraped Zagat ratings for thousands of restaurants in the 3 other US cities that Michelin reviews. I used this data to model the relationship between Zagat ratings and Michelin stars (using a random forest regression model) to predict DC restaurants.
